## Code
This is my first project, which as expected, the code is a bit messy more than I care to admit. I may rewrite
this thing in the extremely long future, but for now the main structure will stay like that. Well if you are not here for the source code, continue reading since everything after this is actual information!

## What ROM to use? And what translation patch?
This randomizer has been tested with the a ROM with the headered 1.1 version, with the translation patch made by
Quirino, [available here.](https://forums.serenesforest.net/index.php?/topic/49096-updated-mystery-of-the-emblem-fan-translation-version-014-released/). 

Also it works with a clean headered 1.1/1.0 ROM. A 1.0 ROM with the translation should 99% work.

For now, the randomizer does not support a ROM without a header. You can easily add one using a tool like tush.
